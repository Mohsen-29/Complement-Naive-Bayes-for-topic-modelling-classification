# Complement-Naive-Bayes-for-topic-moddeling-classification
 In this work, a Complement Naive Bayes classifier was trained on a text dataset with 4 classes. The classifier was able to achieve high precision and recall scores on classes 0, 1, and 2, but performed poorly on class 3, with a low recall score. Overall, the classifier achieved good accuracy, but there is room for improvement on class 3.
